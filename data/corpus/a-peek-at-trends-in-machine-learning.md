Have you looked at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?cat=)?
It’s pretty cool — you enter some keywords and see how Google Searches of that
term vary through time. I thought — hey, I happen to have this [arxiv-
sanity](http://arxiv-sanity.com/) database of 28,303 (arxiv) Machine Learning
papers over the last 5 years, so why not do something similar and take a look
at how Machine Learning research has evolved over the last 5 years? The
results are fairly fun, so I thought I’d post.

_(Edit: machine learning is a large area. A good chunk of this post is about
deep learning specifically, which is the subarea I am most familiar with.)_

### The arxiv singularity

Let’s first look at the total number of submitted papers across the arxiv-
sanity categories (**cs.AI,cs.LG,cs.CV,cs.CL,cs.NE,stat.ML**), over time. We
get the following:

Yes, March of 2017 saw almost 2,000 submissions in these areas. The peaks are
likely due to conference deadlines (e.g. NIPS/ICML). Note that this is not
directly a statement about the size of the area itself, since not everyone
submits their paper to arxiv, and the fraction of people who do likely changes
over time. But the point remains — that’s a lot of papers to be aware of,
skim, or (gasp) read.

This total number of papers will serve as the denominator. We can now look at
what fraction of papers contain certain keywords of interest.

### Deep Learning Frameworks

To warm up let’s look at the Deep Learning frameworks that are in use. To
compute this, we record the fraction of papers that mention the framework
somewhere in the full text (anywhere — including bibliography etc). For papers
uploaded on March 2017, we get the following:

    
    
    % of papers 	 framework 	 has been around for (months)  
    ------------------------------------------------------------  
        9.1          tensorflow       16  
        7.1               caffe       37  
        4.6              theano       54  
        3.3               torch       37  
        2.5               keras       19  
        1.7          matconvnet       26  
        1.2             lasagne       23  
        0.5             chainer       16  
        0.3               mxnet       17  
        0.3                cntk       13  
        0.2             pytorch       1  
        0.1      deeplearning4j       14

That is, 10% of all papers submitted in March 2017 mention TensorFlow. Of
course, not every paper declares the framework used, but if we assume that
papers declare the framework with some fixed random probability independent of
the framework, then it looks like about 40% of the community is currently
using TensorFlow (or a bit more, if you count Keras with the TF backend). And
here is the plot of how some of the more popular frameworks evolved over time:

We can see that Theano has been around for a while but its growth has somewhat
stalled. Caffe shot up quickly in 2014, but was overtaken by the TensorFlow
singularity in the last few months. Torch (and the very recent PyTorch) are
also climbing up, slow and steady. It will be fun to watch this develop in the
next few months — my own guess is that Caffe/Theano will go on a slow decline
and TF growth will become a bit slower due to PyTorch.

### ConvNet Models

For fun, how about if we look at common ConvNet models? Here, we can clearly
see a huge spike up for ResNets, to the point that they occur in 9% of all
papers last March:

Also, who was talking about “ _inception_ ” before the InceptionNet? Curious.

### Optimization algorithms

In terms of optimization algorithms, it looks like
[Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) is on a roll, found in about 23% of
papers! The actual fraction of use is hard to estimate; it’s likely higher
than 23% because some papers don’t declare the optimization algorithm, and a
good chunk of papers might not even be optimizing any neural network at all.
It’s then likely lower by about 5%, which is the “background activity” of
“Adam”, likely a collision with author names, as the Adam optimization
algorithm was only released on Dec 2014.

### Researchers

I was also curious to plot the mentions of some of the most senior PIs in Deep
Learning (this gives something similar to citation count, but 1) it is more
robust across population of papers with a “0/1” count, and 2) it is normalized
by the total size of the pie):

A few things to note: “bengio” is mentioned in 35% of all submissions, but
there are two Bengios: Samy and Yoshua, who add up on this plot. In
particular, Geoff Hinton is mentioned in more than 30% of all new papers! That
seems like a lot.

## Hot or Not Keywords

Finally, instead of manually going by categories of keywords, let’s actively
look at the keywords that are “hot” (or not).

### Top hot keywords

There are many ways to define this, but for this experiment I look at each
unigram or bigram in all the papers and record the ratio of its max use last
year compared to its max use up to last year. The papers that excel at this
metric are those that one year ago were niche, but this year appear with a
much higher relative frequency. The top list (slightly edited out some
duplicates) comes out as follows:

    
    
    8.17394726486 resnet  
    6.76767676768 tensorflow  
    5.21818181818 gans  
    5.0098386462 residual networks  
    4.34787878788 adam  
    2.95181818182 batch normalization  
    2.61663993305 fcn  
    2.47812783318 vgg16  
    2.03636363636 style transfer  
    1.99958217686 gated  
    1.99057177616 deep reinforcement  
    1.98428686543 lstm  
    1.93700787402 nmt  
    1.90606060606 inception  
    1.8962962963 siamese  
    1.88976377953 character level  
    1.87533998187 region proposal  
    1.81670721817 distillation  
    1.81400378481 tree search  
    1.78578069795 torch  
    1.77685950413 policy gradient  
    1.77370153867 encoder decoder  
    1.74685427385 gru  
    1.72430399325 word2vec  
    1.71884293052 relu activation  
    1.71459655485 visual question  
    1.70471560525 image generation

For example, ResNet’s ratio of 8.17 is because until 1 year ago it appeared in
up to only 1.044% of all submissions (in Mar 2016), but last last month (Mar
2017) it appeared in 8.53% of submissions, so 8.53 / 1.044 ~= 8.17. So there
you have it — the core innovations that became all the rage over the last year
are **1) ResNets, 2) GANs, 3) Adam, 4) BatchNorm**. Use more of these to fit
in with your friends. In terms of research interests, we see 1) style
transfer, 2) deep RL, 3) Neural Machine Translation (“nmt”), and perhaps 4)
image generation. And architecturally, it is hot to use 1) Fully Convolutional
Nets (FCN), 2) LSTMs/GRUs, 3) Siamese nets, and 4) Encoder decoder nets.

### Top not hot

How about the reverse? What has seen many fewer submissions over the last year
than has historically had a higher “mind share”? Here are a few:

    
    
    0.0462375339982 fractal  
    0.112222705524 learning bayesian  
    0.123531424661 ibp  
    0.138351983723 texture analysis  
    0.152810895084 bayesian network  
    0.170535340862 differential evolution  
    0.227932960894 wavelet transform  
    0.24482875551 dirichlet process

I’m not sure what “fractal” is referring to, but more generally it looks like
bayesian nonparametrics are under attack.

## Conclusion

Now is the time to submit paper on Fully Convolutional Encoder Decoder
BatchNorm ResNet GAN applied to Style Transfer, optimized with Adam. Hey, that
doesn’t even sound too far-fetched.
