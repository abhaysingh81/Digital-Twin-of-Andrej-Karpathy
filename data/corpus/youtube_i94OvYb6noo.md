okay so let me dive into some
administrative points first so again
recall that assignment 1 is due next
Wednesday you have about 150 hours left
and I use hours because there's a more
imminent sense of doom and remember that
third of those hours you'll be
unconscious so you don't have that much
time it's really running out and you
know you might think that you have late
days and so on but the easiest time is
just get harder over time so you want to
save those and so on so start now let's
see so there's no office hours or
anything like that on Monday I'll hold
make up office hours on Wednesday
because I want you guys to be able to
talk to me about especially projects and
so on so I'll be moving my office hours
from Monday to wednesday usually I have
my office hours at 6 p.m. instead I'll
have them at 5 p.m. and usually it's in
gates to 60 but now I'll be in gates to
59 so minus 1 on both and yeah and also
to note when you're going to be studying
for a midterm that's coming up in a few
weeks make sure you go through the
lecture notes as well which are really
part of this class and I kind of pick
and choose some of the things that I
think are most valuable to present in a
lecture but there's quite a bit of you
know more material to be aware of that
might pop up in the midterm even though
I'm covering some of the most important
stuff usually in the lecture so do read
through those lecture notes they're
complementary to the lectures and so the
material for the midterm will be drawn
from both the lectures and the notes ok
so having said all that we're going to
dive into the material so where we are
right now just as a reminder we have the
score function we've looked at several
loss functions such as the SPM loss
function last time and we looked at the
full loss that you achieve for any
particular set of weights on over your
training data and this loss is made up
of two components there's a data loss
and a regularization loss right and
really what we want to do is we want to
derive now the gradient expression of
the loss function with respect to the
weights and we want to do this so that
we can actually perform the optimization
process and in the optimization process
we're doing a gradient descent where we
iterate evaluating the gradient on your
weights doing a parameter update and
just repeating this over and over again
so that we're converging
to the low points of that loss function
and when we arrive at a low loss that's
equivalent to making good predictions
over our training data in terms of the
scores that come out now we also saw
that there are two kind of ways to
evaluate the gradient there's a
numerical gradient and this is very easy
to write but it's extremely slow to
evaluate and there's analytic gradient
which is which you obtained by using
calculus and we'll be going into that in
this lecture quite a bit more and so
it's fast exact which is great but it's
not you can get it wrong sometimes and
so we always perform what we call Radian
check where we write all the expressions
to compute the analytic gradient and
then we double check its correctness
with numerical gradient and so I'm not
sure if you're going to see that you're
going to see that definitely in the
assignments okay so now you might be
tempted to when you see this set up we
just want to derive the gradient of the
last function with respect to the
weights you might be tempted to just you
know write out the full loss and just
start to take the gradients as you see
in your calculus class but the point I'd
like to make is that you should think
much more of this in terms of
computational graphs instead of instead
of just taking thinking of one giant
expression that you're going to derive
on pen with pen and paper the expression
for the gradient and the reason for that
so here we're thinking about these
values flow flowing through a
computational graph where we have these
operations along circles and they
transfer they're basically function
pieces that transform your inputs all
the way to the loss function at the end
so we start off with our data and our
parameters as inputs they feed through
this computational graph which is just
an oldy series of functions along the
way and at the end we get a single
number which is the loss and the reason
that I'd like you to think about it this
way is that these expressions right now
look very small and you might be able to
derive these gradients but these
expressions are and computational graphs
are about to get very big and so for
example convolutional neural networks
will have hundreds maybe or dozens of
operations so we'll have all these
images flowing through like pretty big
computational graph to get our loss and
so it becomes impractical to just write
out these expressions and convolutional
networks are not even the worst of it
once you actually start to for example
do something called a neural Turing
machine which is a paper from deep mind
where this is basically a differentiable
Turing machine so the whole thing
differentiable the whole procedure that
the computer is performing on the tape
is made smooth and is differentiable
computer basically and the computational
graph of this is huge and not only is
this this is not it because what you end
up doing and we're going to recurrent
neural networks in a bit but what you
end up doing is you end up enrolling
this graph so think about this graph
copied many hundreds of time steps and
so you end up with this giant monster of
hundreds of thousands of nodes and
little computational units and so it's
impossible to write out you know here's
the loss for the neural Turing machine
it's just impossible it would take like
billions of pages and so we have to
think about this more in terms of data
structures of little functions
transforming intermediate variables to
gets loss at the variant okay so we're
going to be looking specifically at
computational graphs and how we can
derive the gradient on the inputs with
respect to the loss function at the very
end okay so let's start off simple and
concrete so let's consider a very small
computational graph where we have three
scalars as an inputs to this graph XY
and Z and they take on the specific
values in this example of negative 2 5
and negative 4 and we have this very
small graph or circuit you'll hear me
refer to these interchangeably either as
a graph or a circuit so we have this
graph that at the end gives us this
output negative 12 ok so here what I've
done is I've already prefilled what
we'll call the forward pass of this
graph where I set the inputs and then I
compute the outputs ok and now we'd like
to do is we'd like to derive the
gradients of the expression on the
inputs and so what we'll do now is I'll
introduce this intermediate variable Q
after the plus gate so there's a plus
gate and a times gate as I'll refer to
them and this plus gate is computing
this output Q and so Q is this
intermediate as a result of X plus y and
then F is a multiplication of Q and Z
and what I've written out here is
basically what we want is the gradients
the derivatives DF by DX DF by dy DF by
DZ and I've written out the intermediate
these little gradients for every one of
these two expressions separately so now
we've performed the forward paths going
from left to right and what we'll do now
is we'll derive the backward pass we'll
go from the back to the front
computing gradients of all the
intermediates in our circuit until at
the very end we're going to be left
the gradients on the inputs and so we
start off at the very right and as a
base case sort of of this recursive
procedure we're considering the gradient
of F with respect to F so this is just
the identity function so what is the
derivative of just it identity mapping
where's the gradient of DF by DF it's 1
right so the identity has a gradient of
1 so that's our base case we start off
with 1 and now we're going to go
backwards through this graph so we want
the gradient of F with respect to Z so
what is that in this computational graph
ok it's Q so we have that written out
right here and what is Q in this
particular example it's 3 right so the
gradient on Z
according to this will become just 3 so
I'm going to be writing the gradients
under the lines in red and the values
are in green above the lines so with the
gradient on the in the front is 1 and
now the gradient on Z is 3 and what
thread 3 is telling you really
intuitively keep in mind the
interpretation of a gradient is what
that's saying is that the influence of Z
on the final value is positive and with
sort of a force of 3 so if I increment Z
by a small amount H then the output of
the circuit will react by increasing
because it's a positive 3 will increase
by 3 H so a small change will result in
a positive change on the output now the
gradient on Q in this case will be so DF
by DQ is said what is that negative 4
okay so we get a gradient of negative 4
on that part of the circuit and what
that's saying is that if Q were to
increase then the output of the circuit
will decrease ok bye if you increase by
H the output of the circuit will
decrease by 4 H that's the slope is
negative 4 ok now we're going to
continue this recursive process through
this plus gate and this is where things
get slightly interesting I suppose so
we'd like to compute the gradient on F
on Y
with respect to Y and so the gradient on
Y with this in this particular graph
will become let's just guess and then
we'll see how this gets derived properly
so I hear some murmurs of the right
answer it will be negative four so let's
see how so there are many ways to derive
it at this point because the expression
is very small and you can kind of glance
at it but the way I'd like you to think
about this is by applying chain rule
okay so the chain rule says that if you
would like to derive the gradient of F
on Y then it's equal to DF by DQ times
DQ by dy right and so we've computed
both of those expressions in particular
DQ by dy we know is negative four so
that's the effect of the influence of Q
on F is DF by DQ which is negative four
and now we know the look we'd like to
know the local influence of Y on Q and
that local influence of Y on Q is one
because that's the local as I'll refer
to as the local derivative of Y for the
plus skate and so the chain rule tells
us that the correct thing to do to chain
these two gradients the local gradient
of Y on Q and the kind of global
gradient of Q on the output of the
circuit is to multiply them so we'll get
negative 4 times 1 and so this is kind
of the the crux of how back propagation
works is this is very important to
understand here that we have these two
pieces that we keep multiplying through
when we perform this chain rule we have
Q computed X plus y and the derivative
on x and y with respect to that single
expression is 1 and 1 so keep in mind
the interpretation of the gradient what
that's saying is that x and y have a
positive influence on Q with a slope of
1 so increasing X by H will increase Q
by H okay and now what we eventually
like is we'd like the influence of Y on
the final output of the circuit and so
the way this ends up working is you take
the influence of Y on Q and we know the
influence of Q on the final loss which
is what we are recursively computing
here through this graph and the correct
thing to do is to multiply them so we
end up with a negative 4 times 1 okay
even negative 4 and so the way this
works out is basically what this is
saying is that the influence of Y on the
final
but the circuit is negative for so
increasing why should decrease the
output of the circuit by negative four
times the little change that you've made
and the way that ends up working out is
why has a positive influence on Q so
increasing Y slightly increases Q which
likely decreases the output of the
circuit okay so chain rule is kind of
giving us this correspondence good yeah
thank you so we're going to get into
this you'll see many basically centaur
classes about this
so you'll see many many instantiations
of this and I'll drill this into you by
the end of this class and you'll
understand it you will not have any
symbolic expressions anywhere once we
compute this once we're actually
implementing this and you'll see
implementations of it later in this
Innis it will always be just vectors and
numbers row vectors numbers okay and
looking at X we have a very similar that
happens thing that happens we want DF by
DX that's our final objective but and we
have to combine it we know what the X is
what is X's influence on Q and what
excuse influence on the end of the
circuit and so that ends up being a
chain rule so you take a negative 4
times 1 and gives you negative 1 okay so
the way this works to generalize a bit
from this example and the way to think
about it is as follows
you are a gate embedded in a circuit and
this is a very large computational graph
or circuit and you receive some inputs
some particular numbers X and y come in
and you perform some operation on them
and compute some output set Z ok
and now now this value of Z goes into
computational graph and something
happens to it but you're just a gate
hanging out in a circuit and you're not
sure what happens but by the end of the
circuit the loss gets computed ok and
that's the forward pass and then we're
proceeding recursively in the reverse
order backwards but before that actually
before I get to that part
you've really right away when I get x
and y the thing I'd like to point out
that during the forward pass if you're
this gate and you get your values x and
y you compute your output Z and there's
another thing you can compute right away
and that is the local gradients on x and
y so I can compute those right away
because I'm just a gate and I know what
I'm performing like say additional
multiplication so I know the influence
that x and y i have on my output value
can compute those guys right away okay
what but then what happens near the end
so the loss gets computed and now we're
going backwards I'll eventually learn
about what is my influence on the final
output of the circuit the loss so I'll
learn what is DL by DZ in there
the gradient will flow into me and what
I have to do is I have to chain that
gradient through this recursive case so
I have to make sure to chain the
gradient through my operation that I
performed and it turns out that the
correct thing to do here by chain rule
really what it's saying is the correct
thing to do is to multiply your local
gradient with that gradient and that
actually gives you the DL by DX that
gives you the influence of X on the
final output of the circuit so really
chain rule is just this added
multiplication where we take our what
I'll called global gradient of this gate
on the output and we change it through
the local gradient and the same thing
goes for Y so it's just a multiplication
of that guy the that gradient by your
local gradient if you're a gate and then
remember that these X's and Y's there
are coming from different gates right so
you end up with recursing this process
through the entire computational circuit
and so these gates just basically
communicate to each other the influence
on the final loss so they tell each
other okay if this is a positive
gradient that means you're positively
influencing Glaus and if it's a negative
gradient your negative influence
negatively influencing loss and these
just gets all multiplied through the
circuit by these local gradients and you
end up with and this process is called
back propagation it's a way of computing
through a recursive application of chain
rule through computational graph the
influence of every single intermediate
value in that graph on the final loss
function and so we'll see many examples
of this throughout this lecture I'll go
into a specific example that is slightly
larger and we'll work through it in
detail but I don't know if there are any
questions at this point that anyone
would like to ask go ahead
if Z is used by multiple notes I'm going
to come back to that
ul you add the gradients the gradient
the correct thing to do is to add them
so if Z is being influenced in multiple
places in the circuit the backward flows
will add but we'll come back to that
point and the way you randomly
initialize your weights you end up that
this is your squashing function the
value of that is somewhere on the
asymptotes then we are computing the
gradient to change so I think I would I
would have repeated your question but
you're jumping ahead like hundred slides
mm-hmm so we're going to get to all of
those issues and we're going to see yeah
you're going to get what we call
vanishing gradient problems and so on
we'll see okay let's go through another
example to make this more concrete so
here we have another circuit it happens
to be computing a little two-dimensional
signal neuron but for now don't worry
about that interpretation just think of
this as that's an expression so 1 over 1
plus e to the whatever so the number of
inputs here is 5 and we're computing
that function and we have a single
output over there
okay and I translated that mathematical
expression into this computational graph
form so we have to recursively from
inside out compute this expression so we
first do all the little W x axis and
then we add them all up and then we take
a negative of it and then we
exponentiate that and then we add one
and then we finally divide and we get
the result of the expression and so
we're going to do now is we're going to
back propagate through this expression
we're going to compute what the
influence of every single input value is
on the output of this expression what is
the gradient here yeah
so you're so for now so you're concerned
about the interpretation of Plus maybe
in these circles for now let's just
assume that this plus is just a binary
plus is a binary Plus gate and we have
there a plus 1 gate I'm making up these
gates kind of on spot and we'll see that
what is a gator is not a gate is kind of
up to you I'll come back to this point
of it in a bit so for now I just like we
have several more gates that we're using
throughout and so I just like to write
out as we go through this example
several of these derivatives so we have
exponentiation and we know for every
little local gate what these local
gradients are right so we can derive
that using calculus so e to the X
derivative is e to the X and so on so
these are all the operations and also
addition and multiplication which I'm
assuming that you have memorized in
terms of what the gradients look like so
we're going to start off at the end of
the circuit and I've already filled in a
one point zero zero in the in the back
because that's how we always start this
recursion whether 11.0 right because
since that's the gradient on the
identity function now we're going to
back propagate through this 1 over X
operation okay so the derivative of 1
over X the local gradient is negative 1
over x squared so that 1 over X gate
during the forward pass received input
1.37 and right away that 1 over X gate
could have computed what the local
gradient was the local gradient was
negative 1 over x squared and now during
back propagation it has to by chain rule
multiply that local gradient by the
gradient of it on the final output of
the circuit which is easy because it
happens to be at the end so what ends up
being the expression for the back
propagated gradient here from the 1 over
x gate the chain will always has two
pieces local gradient times the gradient
from the top or from above
- yeah okay yes that's correct
so we get minus one over x squared which
is a gradient DF by DX so that that is
the local gradient negative one over
three point seven squared and then
multiplied by one point zero which is
the gradient from above which is really
just one because we just started and so
I'm applying chain rule right away here
and the output is negative zero point
five three so that's the gradient on
that piece of the wire where this Valley
was flowing okay
so it has a negative effect on the
output and you might expect that right
because if you were to increase this
value and then it goes through a gate of
1 over X then if you increase this then
1 over X gets smaller so that's why
you're seeing negative gradient right so
we're going to continue back propagation
here the next gate in the circuit it's
adding a constant of one so the local
gradient if you look at adding a
constant to a value the gradient of X is
just one right for basic calculus and so
the chain gradient here that we continue
along the wire will be we have local
gradient which is one times the gradient
from above the gate which it has just
learned is negative zero point five
three okay
so negative zero point five three
continues along the wire unchanged and
intuitively that makes sense right
because this this value floats and it
has some influence in the final circuit
and now if you're skip if you're adding
one then it's influenced it's rate of
change its slope towards the final value
doesn't change if you increase this by
some amount the effect at the end will
be the same because the rate of change
doesn't change through the plus one gate
it's just a constant offset okay we
continue derivation here so the gradient
of e to the X is e to the X so to
continue back propagation we're going to
perform so this gate saw input of
negative one it right away could have
computed its local gradient and now it
knows that the gradient from above is
negative 0.53 so to continue back
propagation here in applying chain rule
we would receive
okay so these are most of the rhetorical
questions I'm not sure but Mattia
basically e to the negative one which is
e to the X the X input to this X gate
times the chain rule right so the
gradient from above is negative point
five three so we keep multiplying that
on so what is the effect on me and what
do I have an effect on the final end of
the circuit those are being always
multiplied so we get negative point to
this point so now we have a times
negative one gate so what ends up
happening when you do a times negative
one in the computational graph it flips
around right because we have basically a
constant multiplied of input which
happen to be a constant of negative 1 so
negative 1 times 1 times negative 1 gave
us negative 1 in the forward pass and so
now we have to multiply by a that's the
local gradient times the gradient above
which is 0.2 so we end up with just
positive point 2 now so now continuing
back propagation we're back propagating
plus and this plus operation has
multiple inputs here the gradient the
local gradient for the plus gate is 1
and 1 so what ends up happening - what
gradients flow along the output buyers
so the Plaskett has a local gradient on
all of its inputs always will be just
one right because if you just have a
function you know X plus y then for that
function the gradient on either X or Y
is just 1 and so what you end up getting
is just 1 times point 2 and so in fact
for a + gate always you see the same
effect where the local gradient all of
its inputs is 1 and so whatever gradient
it gets from above it just always
distributes gradient equally to all of
its inputs because in a chain rule
they'll get multiplied and when you
multiply by 1 you something remains
unchanged so a plus gate is kind of like
a gradient distributor where if
something flows in from the top it will
just spread out all the all the
gradients equally to all of its children
and so we've already received one of the
inputs is gradient point 2 here on the
very final output of the circuit and so
this influence has been computed through
a series of applications of chain rule
along the way
so now let's there was another + gate
that I've skipped over and so this point
to kind of distributes to both point to
point to equally so we've already done a
+ gate and there's a multiply gate there
and so now we're going to back propagate
through that multiply operation and so
the local grade so the so what will be
the gradients for W 0 and X 0 what will
be the gradient for W 0 specifically
some let's say 0 0 will be wrong it will
be
so the gradient W 1 will be W 0 sorry it
will be negative 1 times point 2 good
and the gradient on X 0 will be there's
a bug by the way in the slide that I
just noticed like few minutes before I
actually create the class so it created
the start in the class so you see 0.39
there it should be point 4 it's because
of a bug in the visualization because
I'm truncating at 2 decimal digits
anyways but basically that should be
point 4 because the way you get that is
two times
point 2 gives you point four just like
I've written out over there so that's
what the output should be there okay so
that's so we've back propagated this
circuit here and we've back propagated
through this expression and so you might
imagine in there are actual downstream
applications we'll have data and all the
parameters as inputs loss functions at
the top at the end so we'll do forward
pass to evaluate the loss function and
then we'll back propagate through every
piece of computation we've done along
the way and we'll back propagate through
every gate to get our inputs and back
propagate just means apply chain rule
many many times and we'll see how that
is implemented in a bit sorry did you
have a question oh yeah so I'm going to
skip that because it's the same so I'm
going to skip the other times gate any
other questions it's point process
that's right so the cost of forward and
backward propagation is roughly equal
well it should be it almost always ends
up being basically equal when you look
at timings usually the backward pass is
slightly slower but yeah ok so let's see
one thing I wanted to point out before
we move on is that the setting of these
gates like these gates are arbitrary so
one thing I could have done for example
is some of you may know this I can
collapse these gates into one gate if I
wanted to for example in there's
something called a sigmoid function
which has that particular form so Sigma
Sigma of X which is the sigmoid function
computes 1 over 1 plus e to the minus X
and so I could have rewritten that
expression and I could have collapsed
all of those gates that made up the
sigmoid gate into a single sigmoid gate
and so there's a sigmoid gate here
and I could have done that in a single
go sort of and what I would have had to
do if I wanted to have that gate is I
need to compute an expression for how
this so what is the local gradient for
the sigmoid gate basically so what is
the gradient on the similar gate on its
input and I have to go through some math
which I'm not going to go into detail
but you end up with that expression over
there it ends up being 1 minus Sigma of
x times sigmoid of X that's the local
gradient and that allows me to now put
this piece into a computational graph
because once I know how to compute the
local gradient everything else is
defined just through chain rule and
multiplying everything together so we
can back propagate through this sigmoid
gate now and the way that would look
like is the input to the sigmoid gate
was 1.0 that's what flu went into the
sigmoid gate and 0.73 went out so 0.73
is Sigma of X ok and now we want the
local gradient which is as we've seen
from the math that I perform there 1
minus Sigma of X times Sigma of X so you
get Sigma of access point 7 3
multiplying 1 minus 0.7 3 that's the
local gradient and then times well we
happen to be at the end of the circuit
so times 1 point 0 which I'm not even
writing so we end up with point 2 and of
course we get the same answer point 2 as
we received before point 2 because
calculus works but basically we could
have broken up this expression down and
did one piece at a time or we could just
have a single sigmoid gate and that's
kind of up to us at what level of
hierarchy do we break these expressions
and so you'd like to intuitively cluster
these expressions into single gates if
it's very efficient or easy to derive
the local gradients because then those
become your pieces
yes so the question is do libraries
typically do that do they worry about
you know what some what's easy to or
convenience to compute and the answer is
yeah I would say so so if you notice
that there's some piece of operation
you'd like to do over and over again and
it has a very simple local gradient then
that's something very appealing to
actually create a single unit out of and
we'll see some of those examples
actually that I think ok I'd like to
also point out that once you the reason
I like to think about these
computational graphs is it really helps
your intuition to think about how
gradients flow in a neural network it's
not just you don't want this to be a
black box to you you want to understand
intuitively how this happens and you
start to develop after a while of
looking at computational graphs
intuitions about how these gradients
flow and this by do a lot so helps you
debug some issues like say we'll go to
vanish and gradient problem it's much
easier to understand exactly what's
going wrong in your optimization if you
understand how gradients flow in
networks it will help you debug these
networks much more efficiently and so
some intuitions for example we already
saw that the 8ab gate it has a local
gradient of 1 to all of its inputs so
it's just a gradient distributor that's
like a nice way to think about it
whenever you have a plus operation
anywhere in your score function or your
ComNet or anywhere else it just
distributes gradients equally the max
gate is instead a gradient router
and the way this works is if you look at
the expression like we have I'll create
these markers don't work so if we have a
very simple binary expression of Max of
X Y so if this is a gate then the
gradient on x and y if you think about
it the gradient on the larger one of
your inputs whichever one is larger the
gradient on that guy is one and all this
and the smaller one has a gradient of
zero and intuitively that's because if
one of these was smaller then wiggling
it has no effect on the output because
the other guy is larger and that's what
ends up propagating through the gate so
you end up with a gradient of 1 on the
larger one of the inputs and so that's
why max gate is a gradient router if I'm
a max gate and I received several inputs
one of them was largest of all of them
and that's the value that I propagated
through the circuit at the back
propagation time I'm just going to
receive my gradient from above and I'm
going to route it to whoever was my
largest input so it's a gradient router
and the multiply gate is a gradient
switcher I'm not actually don't think
that's a very good way to look at it but
I'm referring to the fact that it's not
actually never mind about that part good
so yeah so your question is what happens
if the two inputs are equal when you go
through max gate yeah what happens yeah
you pick one yeah yeah I don't think
it's correct to distribute it to all of
them I think you'd have to you'd have to
pick one yeah but that basically never
happens in actual practice okay so max
gradient here actually have an example
so said here was larger than W so only
zet has an influence on the output of
this max gate right so when two flows
into the max gate it gets routed to Z
and W gets a zero gradient because its
effect on the circuit is nothing there's
zero because when you change it it
doesn't matter when you change it
because that is the larger value going
through the computational graph I have
another note that is related to the back
propagation which we already addressed
through a question I just wanted to
briefly point out with a terribly bad
looking figure that if you have these
circuits and sometimes you have a value
that branches out into a circuit and is
used in multiple parts of the circuit
the correct thing to do by multivariate
chain rule is to actually add up the
contributions at at the operation so
gradients add when they back propagate
backwards through the circuit if they
ever flow they add up in in these in
this backward flow all right we're going
to go into implementation very soon I'll
just take some little questions thank
you for the question the question is is
there ever like loop in these graphs
there will never be loops so there are
never any loops you might think that if
you use a recurrent neural network that
there are loops in there but there's
actually no loops because what we'll do
is we will take a recurrent neural
network and will unfold it through time
steps and this will all become there
will never be a loop in the unfolded
graph where we've copy-pasted that small
recurrent
over time you'll see that more when we
actually get into it but these are
always DAGs
there's no loops okay
awesome so let's look at the
implementation how this is actually
implemented in practice and I think will
help make this more concrete as well so
we always have these graphs
computational graphs these are the best
way to think about structuring neural
networks and so we end up with is all
these gates that we're going to see in a
bit but on top of the gates there's
something that needs to maintain
connectivity structure of this entire
graph what gates are connected to each
other and so usually that's handled by a
graph or a net object usually in net and
the net object has these two main pieces
which has the forward and the backward
piece and this is just pseudocode so
this won't run but basically roughly the
idea is that in the forward pass were
iterating over all the gates in the
circuit that and they're sorted in
topological order what that means is
that all the inputs must come to every
node before the output can be consumed
so these are just ordered from left to
right and we're just forwarding we're
calling a forward on every single gate
along the way so we iterate over that
graph and we just go forward on every
single piece and this net object will
just make sure that that happens in the
proper connectivity pattern and backward
pass we're going in the exact reverse
order and we're calling backward on
every single gate and these gates will
end up communicating gradients to each
other and they all get chained up and
computing the analytic gradient at the
back so really a net object is a very
thin wrapper around all these gates or
as well as well see they're called
layers layers or gates I'm going to use
those interchangeably and they're just
very thin wrappers around connectivity
structure of these gates and calling a
forward and backward function on them
and then let's look at a specific
example of one of the gates and how this
might be implemented and this is not
justice Souter this is actually more
like correct implementation in some
sense like this might run at the end so
let's say they're multiplied gate and
how it could be implemented a multiply
gate in this case is just a binary
multiply so it receives two inputs X and
y it computes their multiplication that
is x times y and inverter instead and
all these gates must basically satisfy
this API of a forward call and a
backward call how do you behave in a
forward pass and how do you behave in a
backward pass and in a forward pass we
just compute whatever
in a backward pass we eventually end up
learning about what is our gradient on
the final loss so DL by D zet is what we
learn that's represented in this
variable DZ and right now everything
here is scalars so X Y Z our numbers
here D Zed is also a number telling the
influence on the end of the circuit and
what this gate is in charge of and in
this backward pass is performing the
little piece of chain rule so what we
have to compute is how do you change
this gradient DZ into your inputs x and
y in other words we have to compute DX
and dy and we have to return those in
the backward pass and then the
computational graph will make sure that
these get routed properly to all the
other gates and if there are any edges
that add up the computational graph
might add might add all those gradients
together ok so how would we implement
the DX and dy so for example what is DX
in this case what would it be equal to
the implementation y times DZ right and
so y times DZ additional point to make
here by the way note that I've added
some lies in the forward pass we have to
remember these values x and y because we
end up using them in a backward pass so
I'm assigning them to a sell stop
because I need to remember what X Y are
because I need access to them in my
backward pass in general in back
propagation and when we build these when
you actually do the forward pass every
single gate must remember the inputs and
any kind of intermediate calculations
that has performed that it needs to do
that needs access to in the backward
pass so basically when we end up running
these networks at runtime just always
keep in mind that as you're doing this
forward pass a huge amount of stuff gets
cached in your memory and that all has
to stick around because during back
propagation you might need access to
some of those variables and so your
memory ends up ballooning up during a
forward pass and then in backward pass
it gets all consumed and you need all
those intermediates to actually compute
the proper backward pass so that's yes
if you don't if you know you don't want
to do backward pass then you can get rid
of many of these things and you don't
have to compute you're going to catch
them so you can save on memory for sure
but I don't think most implementations
actually worry about that I don't think
there's a lot of logic that deals with
that usually we end up remembering it
anyway oh I see yeah so I think if
you're an embedded device for example
and you worry really about your memory
constraints this is something that you
might take advantage of if you know that
a neural network only has to run and
test time then you might want to make
sure to go into the code and make sure
nothing gets cached
in case you want to do a backward pass
questions yes
you're saying if we remember the local
gradients in the in the forward pass
then we don't have to remember the other
intermediates
I think that might only be the case in
some simple expressions like this one
I'm not actually sure that's true in
general but I mean you're in charge of
remember whatever you need to perform
the backward pass they only gate by gate
basis you don't necessarily feel like it
has a lower footprint and so on and you
can be clever with that okay so just to
give you guys example of what this looks
like in practice we're going to look at
specific example say in torch torches a
deep learning framework which we might
go into a bit near the end of the class
that some of you might end up using for
your projects if you go into the github
repo for torch and you look at like
basically it's just giant collection of
these layer objects and these are the
gates layers gates the same thing so
there's all these layers that's really
what a deep learning framework is is
just a whole bunch of layers and a very
thin computational graph thing that
keeps track of all the layer
connectivity and so really the image to
have in mind is all these things are
your Lego blocks and then we're building
up these computational graphs out of
your Lego blocks out of the layers
you're putting them together in various
ways depending on what you want to
achieve and so you end up building all
kinds of stuff so that's how you work
with neural networks so every library is
just a whole set of
layers that you might want to compute
and every layer is just implementing a
small peak function piece and that
function Pease knows how to do a forward
and it knows how to do a backward so
just to be the specific example let's
look at the mall constant layer in torch
the mall constant layer performs just
the scaling by a scalar so it takes some
tensor X so this is not just a scalar
but it's actually like an array of
numbers basically because when we
actually work with these we do a lot of
vectorize operations so we receive a
tensor which is really just a n
dimensional array and we scale it by a
constant and you can see that this layer
actually just has 40 lines there's some
initialization stuff this is low up by
the way if this is looking some foreign
to you but there's initialization where
you actually pass in that a that you
want to use as you're scaling and then
during the forward pass which they call
update output in a forward pass all they
do is they just multiply a X and return
it and in the backward pass which they
call update grad input there's an if
statement here but really when you look
at these three lines that are most
important you can see that all it's
doing is it's copying into a variable
grad input which needs to compute that's
your gradient that you're passing up the
grad input is you're copying grad output
grad output is your your gradient on the
final loss you're copying that over into
grad input and you're multiplying by the
by the scalar which is what you should
be doing because you're your local
gradient is just a and so you take the
output you have you take the gradient
from above and you just scale it by a
which is what these three lines are
doing and that's your grad input and
that's what you return so that's one of
the hundreds of layers that are in torch
we can also look at examples in cafe
cafe is also deep learning framework
specifically for images that you might
be working with again if you go into the
layers directory and github you just see
all these layers all of them implement
the forward backward API so just to give
you an example there's a sigmoid layer
in cafe so sigmoid layer takes a blob so
cafe likes to call these tensors blobs
so it takes a blob is just an N
dimensional array of numbers and it
passes it element-wise through a sigmoid
function and so it's computing in a
forward pass a sigmoid which you can see
there I'll use my pointer okay so there
it's calling so a lot of this stuff is
just boilerplate getting
to all the data and then we have a
bottom blob and we're calling a sigmoid
function on the bottom and that's just
the sigmoid function right there so
that's what we compute and in a backward
pass some boilerplate stuff but really
what's important is we need to compute
the gradient times the chain rule here
so that's what you see in this line
that's where the magic happens where we
take the diff so they call the gradients
diffs and you compute the bottom this is
the top diff times this piece which is
really the that's the local gradient so
this is chain rule happening right here
through that multiplication so and
that's it and so every single layer just
a forward backward API and then you have
a computational graph on top or a net
object that keeps track of all the
connectivity okay any questions about
some of these implementations and so on
go ahead
yes thank you so the question is do you
have to go through forward and backward
for every update the answer is yes
because when you want to do update you
need the gradient and so you need to do
forward on your sample mini-batch you do
it forward you right away do a backward
and now you have your NLE gradient and
now i can do an update where I take my
analytic gradient and I change my
weights a tiny bit in the direction the
negative grid direction of your gradient
so forward computes the loss backward
computes your gradient and then the
update uses the gradient to increment
your weights a bit so that's what keeps
happening in loop when you train a
neural network that's all that's
happening forward backward update
forward backward update we'll see that
in a bit good you're asking about the
for loop oh is there for loop here I
didn't even notice okay
yeah they have a for loop yeah so you'd
like this to be vectorized I'm not
actually sure because this is C++ so I
think yeah they just stuff just do it go
for it yeah yeah so this is a CPU
implementation by the way I should
mention that this is a CPU
implementation of the sigmoid layer
there's a second file that implements
the sigmoid layer on GPU and that's CUDA
code and so that's a separate file it
would be sigmoid Cu or something like
that I'm not showing you that in the
questions okay great so one point I'd
like to make is will be of course
working with vectors so these things
flowing along our graphs are not just
scalars they're going to be entire
vectors and so nothing changes the only
thing that is different now since these
are vectors x y&z are vectors is that
this local gradient which before used to
be just a scalar now they're in general
for general expressions they are full
Jacobian matrices and so Jacobian matrix
is just two-dimensional matrix and
basically tells you what is the
influence of every single element in X
on every single element of Z and that's
what you could be a matrix stores and
the gradient is the same expression as
before but now say here DZ by DX is a
vector and BL by DZ is sorry
DL by DS that is a vector and DZ by DX
is an entire Jacobian matrix so you end
up with an entire matrix vector multiply
to actually change the gradient
backwards no so I'll come I'll come back
to this point in a bit you never
actually end up forming the full
Jacobian you'll never actually do this
matrix multiply most of the time this is
just a general way of looking at you
know arbitrary function and I need to
keep track of this and I think that
these two are actually out of order
because these are by DX is the Jacobian
which should be on the left side so
that's a I think that's a mistake in
slide because this should be a matrix
vector multiply so I'll show you why you
don't actually need to ever form those
jacobians so let's work with a specific
example that is relatively common in
neural networks suppose we have this
non-linearity max of 0 and X so really
what this is operation is doing is it's
receiving a vector say Oh 4096 numbers
which is a typical thing you might want
to do 4096 numbers real-valued come in
and you're computing an element-wise
threshold in a so anything that is lower
than zero gets clamped to zero and
that's your function that you're
computing and so up the vectors are the
same dimension so the question here I'd
like to ask is what is the size of the
Jacobian matrix for this layer
4,096 by 4096 in principle every single
port number in here could have
influenced every single number and there
but that's not the case necessarily
right so the second question is so this
is a huge matrix 16 million numbers but
why would you never form it what does
the Jacobian actually look like no
Jacobian will always be a matrix because
every one of these 4096 could have
influenced every it is so the Jacobian
is still a giant 4096 by 4,000 Isaac's
matrix but it has special structure
right and what is that special structure
good yeah so this Jacobian is a huge so
it's 4096 by 4096 matrix but there's
only elements on the diagonal because
this is an element wise operation and
moreover they're not just once but for
whichever element was less than 0 it was
clamped to 0 so some of these ones
actually are zeros in whichever elements
had a lower than 0 value during the
forward pass and so the Jacobian would
just be almost an identity matrix but
some of them are actually there so you
never actually would want to form the
full Jacobian because that's silly and
so you never actually want to carry out
this operation as a matrix vector
multiply because there's special
structure that we want to take advantage
of and so in particular the gradient the
backward pass for for this operation is
very very easy
because you just want to look at all the
dimensions where your input was less
than 0 and you want to kill the gradient
in those dimension you want to set the
gradient to 0 in those dimensions so you
take the grid output here and whichever
numbers were less than 0 just set them
to 0 set those gradients to 0 and then
you continue backward pass so very
simple operations in the in the end in
terms of efficiency just refer back
that's right that right you could do a
matrix if you needed to in in your
internal state but when you actually
report back you're always just yeah so
the question is the communication
between the gates is always just vectors
that's right so this Jacobian if you
wanted to you can form that but that's
internal to you inside the gate and you
can use that to do backdrop but what's
going back to other gates they only care
about the gradient vector yes so the
question is unless you end up having
multiple outputs because then for each
output we have to do this
and so you yeah so we'll never actually
run into that case because we almost
always have a single output scalar value
at the end because we're interested in
loss functions so we just have a single
number at the end that we're interested
in computing gradients with respect to
if we had multiple outputs then we have
to keep track of all of those as well in
parallel when we do the back propagation
but we just have scalar valued loss
functions so so we don't have to worry
about that okay make sense so I want to
also make the point that actually 4096
dimension is not even crazy usually we
use mini batches so say mini batch of
100 elements going through at the same
time and then you end up with 100 4096
dimensional vectors that are all coming
in in parallel but all the examples in a
mini batch are processed independently
of each other in parallel and so this
Jacobian matrix really ends up being 400
million four hundred thousand by four
hundred thousand so huge so you never
form these basically and you take some
intake care to actually take advantage
of the sparsity structure in that
Jacobian and you hand code operations
you don't actually write the fully
generalized chain rule inside any gate
implementation okay cool so I'd like to
point out that in your assignment you'll
be writing SVM's and softmax and so on
and I just kind of wanted to give you a
hint on the design of how you actually
should approach this problem what you
should do is just think about it as a
back propagation even if you're doing
this linear classification optimization
so roughly your structure should look
something like this where again stage
your computation and units
that you know the local gradient off and
then do backdrop when you actually
evaluate these gradients in your
assignment so in the top your code will
look something like this where we don't
have any graph structure because you're
doing everything in line so no crazy
edges or anything like that that you
have to do you will do that in the
second assignment you'll actually come
up with a graph object and you'll
implement your layers but in the first
assignment you're just doing it in line
just straight up vanilla set up and so
compute your scores based on W and X
compute these margins which are max of
zero and the score differences compute
the loss and then do back drop and in
particular I would really advise you to
have this intermediate scores that you
create as a matrix and then compute the
gradient on scores before you compute
the gradient on your weights and so
chain use chain rule here otherwise
you're like you might be tempted to try
to just derive W the gradient on W
equals and then implement that and
that's an unhealthy way of approaching
the problem so stage your computation
and do back drop through this course and
they will help you out okay
cool so let's see something's in summary
so far neural networks are hopelessly
large so we end up with these
computational structures and these
intermediate nodes forward-backward api
for both the nodes and also for the
graph structure and the graph structure
is usually a very thin wrapper around
all these layers and it can handles all
the communication between them and it's
communication is always along like
vectors being passed around in practice
when we write these implementations what
we're passing around are these
n-dimensional tensors really what that
means is just an N dimensional array so
like a numpy array those are what goes
between the gates and then internally
every single gate knows what to do in
the forward and backward pass ok so at
this point I'm going to end with back
propagation and I'm going to go into
neural networks so any questions before
we move on from background good
the summation inside Li equals blah yeah
so there's a sum there so you'd want
that to be a vectorized operation that
you are yeah so basically the challenge
in your assignment almost is how do you
make sure that you do all of this
efficiently nicely with meters vector
operations in numpy so that's going to
be some of the brainteaser stuff that
you guys are going to have to do yeah so
it's up to you what you want your gates
to be like and what you want them to be
um yeah I don't I don't think you'd want
to do that yeah I'm not sure maybe that
works I don't know but yeah it's up to
you to design this and to backdrop to it
yeah so that's that's fun okay so we're
going to go to neural networks this is
exactly what they look like so you'll be
implementing these and this is just what
happens when you search on google images
for neural networks this is I think the
first results are simple like that
so let's look at neural networks and
before we dive into neural networks
actually I'd like to do it first without
all the brain stuff so forget that their
neural forget that they have any
relation whatsoever to a brain they
don't but forget if you thought that
they did that they do let's just look at
score functions where before we saw that
F equals W X is what we've been working
with so far but now as I said we're
going to start to make that F more
complex and so if you wanted to use a
neural network then you're going to
change that equation to this so this is
a two layer neural network and that's
what it looks like and it's just a more
complex mathematical expression of X and
so what's happening here is you receive
your input X and you make x matrix just
like we did before
now what's come back what comes next is
a non-linearity or activation function
and we're going to go into several
choices that you might make for these in
this case I'm using the threshold again
zero as an activation function
so basically we're doing matrix multiply
we threshold everything negative to zero
and then we do one more matrix multiply
and that gives us our scores and so if I
was to draw this say in case of C for
ten with three solid 3072 numbers going
in those are the pixel values and before
we just went one thing
matrix-multiply to scores we went right
away to ten numbers but now we get to go
through this intermediate representation
of a hidden hidden state we'll call them
hidden players so hidden vector H of
hundred numbers say or whatever you want
your size of their neural network to be
so this is a hyper primer that say that
hundred and we go through this
intermediate representation so matrix
multiply gives us hundred numbers
threshold at zero and then one more
makes multiplied to get this course and
since we have more numbers we have more
wiggle to do more interesting things so
a more one particular example of
something interesting you might want to
what you might think that in your
network could do is going back to this
example of interpreting linear
classifiers on C part N and we saw that
the car class has this red car that
tries to merge all the modes of
different cars facing different
directions and so in this case one
single layer one single linear
classifier had to go across all those
modes and we couldn't deal with for
example the cars of different colors
that wasn't very natural to do but now
we have hundred numbers in this
intermediate and so you might imagine
for example that one of those numbers
could be just picking up on the red car
facing forward it's just classifying is
there a red car facing forward another
one could be a red car facing slightly
to the left
let's car facing slightly to the right
and those elements of H would only
become positive if they find that thing
in the image otherwise they stay at zero
and so another H might look for green
cars or yellow cars or whatever else in
different orientations so now we can
have a template for all these different
modes and so these neurons turn on or
off if they find the thing they're
looking for a car of some specific type
and then this w2 matrix can sum across
all those little car templates so now we
have like say 20 car templates of what
cars could look like and now to compete
the score of car classifier there's an
additional matrix multiply so we have a
choice of doing a weighted sum over them
and so if any one of them turn on then
through my weighted sum with positive
weights presumably I would be adding up
and getting the higher score and so now
I can have a this multi modal car
classifier through this additional
hidden layer in between there so that's
a hand wavy reason for why these would
do
something more interesting was their
question so the question is if H had
less than 10 units would it be inferior
to a linear classifier I think that's a
that's actually not obvious to me it's
an interesting question I think you
could make that work I think it could
make it work
yeah I think that would actually work
someone should try that for extra points
on the assignment so you'll have a
section on the assignment do something
fun or extra and so you get to come up
with whatever you think is interesting
experiment and we'll give you some bonus
points so that's a good candidate for
for something you might want to
investigate whether that works or not
any other questions good that's right
nothing I understood the question yep
yep I think so you're really asking
about the layout of the H vector and how
it gets allocated over the different
modes of the data set and I don't have a
good answer for that this since we're
going to train this fully with back
propagation I think it's likely naive to
think that there will be exact template
for sale left car facing red car facing
left you probably won't find that you'll
find these kind of like mixes and weird
things intermediates and so on so
there's no let work will come in and it
will optimally find a way to truncate
your data with it's linear boundaries
and these weights we're all getting
adjusted just to come to make it come
out right so it's really hard to say
well become tangled up I think good
age was like Jose archer that's right so
that's the size of a head and layer and
that's a hyper parameter we get to
choose that so I chose 100 usually
that's going to be usually you'll see
that with neural networks we'll go into
this a lot but usually you want them to
be as big as possible as it fits in your
computer and so on so more is better but
we'll go into that good so you're asking
do we always take max of 0 and H and we
don't and I'll get it's like 5 slides
that way so I'm going to go into neural
networks I guess maybe I should
preemptively just go ahead and then take
questions near the end if you wanted
this to be a three layer neural network
by the way there's a very simple way in
which we just extend this right so we
just keep continuing the same pattern
where we have all these intermediate
hidden nodes and then we can keep making
our network deeper and deeper and you
can compute more interesting functions
because you're giving yourself more time
to compute something interesting in a
hand wavy way now one other slide I
wanted to flash is that training a two
layer neural network I mean it's
actually quite simple when it comes down
to it so this is a slide borrowed from a
blog post I found and basically it
suffice as roughly 11 lines of Python to
implement a two layer neural network
doing binary classification on what is
this two dimensional data so you have a
two dimensional data matrix X you have
sorry it's three dimensional and you
have binary labels for Y and then sin 0
sin 1 are your weight matrices weight
one way to and so I think they're called
sin for sin apps but I'm not sure and
then this is the optimization loop here
and what you're seeing here I should use
my pointer more what you're seeing here
is we're computing the first layer
activations but this is using a sigmoid
non-linearity not a max of 0 necks and
we're going to a bit of what these
linked nonlinearities might be so
sigmoid is one form is computing the
first layer and then computing the
second layer and then it's computing
here right away the backward pass so
this is the l2 Delta is the gradient on
l2 the gradient on l1 and the gradient
and this is a Maitre is an update here
so right away he's doing an update at
the same time as doing the final piece
of backdrop here where he's formulating
the gradient on the W and right
he's adding to - gradient here and so
really 11 lines suffice to train the
neural network do a binary
classification the reason that this loss
might look slightly different from what
you've seen right now is that this is a
logistic regression loss so you saw a
generalization of it which is the
softmax classifier into multiple
dimensions but this is basically a
logistic loss being updated here and you
can go through this in more detail by
yourself but the logistic regression
loss looks slightly different and that's
being that's inside there but otherwise
yes so this is not too crazy of a
computation and very few lines of code
suffice to actually train these networks
everything else is Plouffe how do you
make it efficient how do you there's a
cross-validation pipeline that you need
to have and all this stuff that goes on
top to actually give these large code
bases but the kernel of it is quite
simple we compute these layers do
forward pass we do backward pass we do
an update which isn't raining this over
and over again good the random function
is creating your first initial random
weights so you need to start somewhere
so you generate a random W ok now I
wanted to mention that you'll also be
training a two layer neural network in
this class so you'll be doing something
very similar to this but you're not
using logistic regression and you might
have different activation functions but
again just my advice to you when you
implement this is stage your computation
into these intermediate results and then
do proper back propagation into every
intermediate result so you might have
you compute your let's see you compute
you receive these weight matrices and
also the biases I don't believe you have
biases actual on your SVM n in your
softmax but here you'll have biases so
take your weight matrices and the biases
compute the first inner layer compete
your scores compete your loss and then
do backward pass so back drop into
scores then back drop into the weights
at the second layer and back drop into
this h1 vector and then through h1 back
drop into the first weight matrices and
the first biases okay so do proper back
propagation here otherwise if you try to
write away just say what is DW 1 what is
the gradient on W 1 if you just try to
make it a single expression for it it
will be way too large and you'll have
headaches so do it through series of
steps in back propagation
no that's just a hint okay so now I'd
like to so that was the presentation of
neural networks without all the brain
stuff and so it looks fairly simple so
now we're going to make it slightly more
insane by folding in all kinds of like
motivations mostly historical about like
how this came about that it's related to
bringing it all and so we have neural
networks and we have neurons inside
these neural networks so this is what
neurons look like this is just what
happens when you search on image search
neurons so there you go now your actual
biological neurons don't look like this
for cuddling they actually look more
like that and so a neuron just very
briefly just to give you an idea about
where this is all coming from you have a
cell body or a soma as people like to
call it and it's got all these dendrites
that are connected to other neurons
there's a cluster of other neurons and
cell bodies over here and dendrites are
really these appendages that listen to
them so this is your inputs to a neuron
and then it's got a single axon that
comes out of a neuron that carries the
the output of the computation that this
neuron performs so usually usually have
this neuron receives inputs if many of
them align then this cell the neuron can
choose to spike it sends an activation
potential down the axon and then this
actually like diverges out to connect to
dendrites of other neurons that are
downstream so there are other neurons
here and their dendrites connect to the
axons of these guys so basically just
neurons connected through these synapses
in between and we have these dendrites
that are the input to neuron and this
axon that actually carries the output of
a neuron and so basically you can come
up with a very crude model of a neuron
and it will look something like this we
have an axon so this is the cell body
here of a neuron and just imagine an
axon coming from a different neuron
somewhere in the network and this neuron
is connected to that neuron through this
synapse and every one of these synapses
has a weight associated with it of how
much this neuron likes that neuron
basically and so axon carries this X it
interacts in the synapse and they
multiply in this crude model so you get
W 0 X 0 floating a flowing to the soma
and then that happens for many neurons
so you have lots of inputs
W times X flowing in and the cell body
here it just performs in some offset by
bias and then if an activation function
is met here so it passes through an
activation function to actually compute
the output of this axon now in
biological models historically people
like to use the sigmoid non-linearity to
actually use for the activation function
the reason for that is because you get a
number between 0 and 1 and you can
interpret that as the rate at which this
neuron is firing for that particular
input so it's a rate between 0 and 1
that's going through the activation
function so if this neuron is seeing
something it likes in the neurons that
connect to it it will start to spike a
lot and the rate is described by F of
the input okay so that's the crude model
of a neuron if I want to implement this
it would look something like this
so a neuron tick function forward pass
it receives some inputs this is a vector
and we form of some at the cell body so
just a linear sum and we put and we
compete the firing rate as a sigmoid of
the cell body sum and return the firing
rate and then this can plug in two
different neurons right so you can
imagine you can actually see that this
looks very similar to a linear
classifier right we're forming a linear
sum here a weighted sum and we're
passing that through a non-linearity so
every single neuron in this model is
really like a small linear classifier
but these linear classifiers plug into
each other and they can work together to
do interesting things now one note to
make about neurons is that they're very
they're not like biological neurons
biological neurons are super complex so
if you go around and you start saying
that neural networks work like brain
people are starting to frown and people
start to frown at you and that's because
neurons are complex dynamical systems
there are many different types of
neurons they function differently these
dendrites there they can perform lots of
interesting computation a good review
article is a dendrite computation which
I really enjoyed these synapses are
complex dynamical systems they're not
just a single weight and we're not
really sure of the brain uses rate code
to communicate so very crude
mathematical model and don't don't push
this analogy too much but it's good for
kind of like media articles and
so I suppose that's why this keeps
coming up again and again as we explain
that this works like your brain but okay
I'm not going to go too deep into this
to go back to a question that was asked
before there's an entire set of
nonlinearities that we can choose from
so historically sigmoid has been used
quite a bit and we're going to go into
much more detail over what these
nonlinearities are what are their trades
trade offs and why you might want to use
one or the other but for now I just like
to flash them and mention that there are
many things to choose from historically
people use sigmoid @nh as of 2012 relu
became quite popular
it makes your networks converge quite a
bit faster so right now if you wanted a
default choice for a non-linearity use
relu that's the current default
recommendation and then there's a few
kind of a hipster activation functions
here and so leaky relatives were
proposed a few years ago max out is
interesting very recently
Allu and so you can come up with
different activation functions and you
can describe why these might work better
or not and so this is an active area of
research is trying to come up with these
activation functions that perform that
had better properties in one way or
another so we're going to go into this
much more detail soon in the class but
for now we have these neurons we have a
choice of activation function and then
we rank these neurons into neural
networks right so we just connect them
together so they can talk to each other
and so here's an example of a what to
layer neural at or 3 layer and all that
when you want to count the number of
layers and their neural net you count
the number of layers that have weights
so here the input layer does not count
as a layer because there's no these
neurons are just single values they
don't actually do any computation so we
have two layers here that that could
have weights so it's a two layer net and
we call these layers fully connected
layers and so remember that I've shown
you that a single neuron computes this
little weighted sum and then passes a
through non-linearity in a neural
network the reason we arrange these into
layers is because arranging them into
layers
allows us to perform the computation
much more efficiently so instead of
having an amorphous blob of neurons and
every one of them has to be computed
independently having them in layers
allows us to use vectorized operations
and so we can compute an entire set of
neurons
single hidden layer as just at a single
time as a matrix multiply and that's why
we arrange them in these layers where
neurons inside a layer can be evaluated
completely in parallel and they all see
the same input so it's a computational
trick to arrange them in layers so this
is a three layer neural net and this is
how you would compute it just a bunch of
matrix multiplies followed by a non
activation followed by a activation
function so now I'd like to show you a
demo of how these neural networks work
so this is JavaScript demo that I'll
show you in a bit but basically this is
an example of a two layer neural network
classifying a doing a binary
classification task so we have two
classes red and green and so we have
these points in two dimensions and I'm
drawing the decision boundaries by the
neural network and so what you can see
is when I train a neural network on this
data the more hidden neurons I have in
my head and layer the more wiggle your
neural network has right the more it can
compute crazy functions and just to show
you effect also of regularization
strength so this is the regularization
of how much you penalize large w's so
you can see that when you insist that
your WS are very small you end up with
very smooth functions so they don't have
as much variance so these neural
networks there's not as much wiggle that
they can give you and then as you
decrease the regularization these neural
networks can do more and more complex
tasks so they can kind of get in and get
these little squeezed out points to
cover them in the training data so let
me show you what this looks like joint
training okay so there's some stuff to
explain here I'll let me first actually
want so you can play with this because
it's all in JavaScript
okay all right so what we're doing here
is we have six neurons and this is a
binary classification data set with with
circle data and so we have a little
cluster of green dot separated by red
dots and we're training a neural network
to classify this data set so if I
restart the neural network it just
started off with a random EE and then it
converges the decision boundary to
actually classify the data what I'm
showing on the right which is the cool
part this is visualized
is one interpretation of the neural
network here is what I'm taking this
grid here and I'm showing how this space
gets warped by the neural network so you
can interpret what the neural network is
doing is its using its hidden layer to
transform your input data in such a way
that the second hidden layer can come in
with a linear classifier and classify
your data so here you see that the
neural network arranges your space it
warps it such that the second layer
which is really a linear classifier on
top of the first layer is again put a
plane through it okay so it's warping
the space so that you can put a plane
through it and separate at the points so
let's look at this again so initial okay
so you can roughly see what how this
gets warped so that you can linearly
classify the data this is something that
people sometimes also refer to as kernel
trick it's changing your data
representation to a space where it's
linearly separable okay now here's a
question if we'd like to separate so
right now we have six neurons here in
the intermediate layer and it allows us
to separate out these data points so you
can see actually those six neurons
roughly you can see these lines here
like they're kind of like these
functions of one of these neurons so
here's a question for you what is the
minimum number of neurons for which this
data set is separable with the neural
network like if I wanted to neural
network to correctly classify this how
many neurons do I need in the hidden
layer as a minimum
for I heard some theories some force and
binary search so intuitively the way
this will work is let's see let's see
for so what happens with for is there's
one neuron here that went from this way
to that way this way to that way this
way to that way there's four neurons
that are cutting up this plane and then
there's an additional layer that's doing
a weighted sum so in fact the lowest
number here with I would be three which
would work so with three neurons oh okay
it's going to happen so one plane second
plane third plane so three linear
functions with a non-linearity and then
you can basically with three lines you
can carve out the space so that the
second layer can just combine them when
their numbers are one and not zero at 2
certainly so at 2 this will break
because two lines are not enough suppose
this work something I'm not going to
look very good here yeah so with two
basically it will find the optimum way
of just using these two lines they're
kind of creating this tunnel and that's
the best you can do ok the curve I think
which shall not only retain my using 10h
yeah I'm not sure exactly how that works
out if I was using relu I think there
would be much Sorrell ooh is the so let
me change to relu and I think you'd see
sharper boundaries yeah yes this is
three oh you can do four so let's do
yeah that's because it's because in some
of these parts there's more than one of
those Ray Lewis are active and so you
end up with there are really 3 lines I
think like 1 2 3 but then in some of the
corners 2 real neurons are active and so
these weights will add up it's kind of
funky you have to think about it a bit
but ok so let's look at say 20 here so
change to 20 so we have lots of space
there and let's look at different data
sets like say spiral so you can see how
this thing just as I'm doing this update
it will just go in there and figure that
out or very simple data set it's not
okay spiral circle yeah and then random
so it's a random data and so it kind of
goes in there and it like covers up the
the green ones from the red ones and
yeah and with fewer say like 5 oh I'm
going to break this now
it's not going to okay so if 5 yeah so
this will start working worse and worse
because you don't have enough capacity
to separate out this data so you can
play with this in your every time okay
and so as a summary we arrange these
neurons into neural in neural networks
into fully connected layers we've looked
at backdrop and how this gets changing
computational graphs and they're not
really neural and as well see soon the
bigger the better and we'll go into that
a lot I want to take questions before I
and just sorry we're not any questions
go ahead we have two more minutes sorry
always better to warn yours or is it
also like over big issues yeah so thank
you so is it always better to have more
neurons in your neural network the
answer to that is yes more it's always
better it's usually computational
constraint so more will always work
better but then you have to be careful
to regularize it properly so the correct
way to constrain your neural networks do
not over fit your data is not by making
the network smaller the correct way to
do it is to increase your regularization
so you always want to use as large of a
network as you want but then you have to
make sure to properly regularize it but
most of the time because computational
reasons you have finite amount of time
you don't want to wait forever to train
your networks you'll use smaller ones
for practical reasons question do you
regularize each layer equally usually
you do as a simplification you yeah most
of the often when you see networks
trained in practice they will be
regularized the same way throughout but
you don't have to necessarily good is
there any value to using second
derivatives using the Hessian in
optimizing neural networks there is
value sometimes when your datasets are
small you can use things like l-bfgs
which I didn't go into too much and
that's a second order method but usually
the datasets are really large and that's
when l-bfgs doesn't work very well so
when you have millions of data points
you can't do l-bfgs for various reasons
yeah and l-bfgs is not very good with
mini-batch you always have to do full
batch by default question
yeah so what is the trade-off between
depth and size roughly like how do you
allocate not a good answer for that
unfortunately so you want depth is good
but maybe after like 10 layers maybe if
you have simple data set it's not really
adding too much we have one more minute
so I can still take some questions you
had a question for awhile yeah so the
the the trade-off between where do I a
locate my capacity do I want this to be
deeper or do I want it to be wider not a
very good answer to that yes usually
especially with images we find that more
layers are critical but sometimes when
you have simple datasets like 2d are
some other things like depth is not as
critical and so it's kind of slightly
data dependent with a question over
there different activation functions for
different layers does that help usually
it's not done usually just kind of pick
one and go with it so say I for comm
that's for example we'll also see that
most of them are trained just with
relatives and so you just use that
throughout and there's no real benefit
to to switching them around people don't
play with that too much but in principle
you there's nothing preventing you so it
is 4/20 so we're going to end here but
we'll see lots of more neural networks
so a lot of these questions will we'll
go through them
